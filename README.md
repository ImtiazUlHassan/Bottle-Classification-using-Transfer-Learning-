# Bottle-Classification-using-Transfer-Learning-
There are many pre-trained models which have been trained on millions of images from the ImageNet database with 1000 different classes which include Inception, ResNet, DenseNet to name a few. However, these models have a large number of parameters, which makes them heavy and unsuitable to be used in low computing and powered devices like Mobile phones.MobileNet was developed by Googleâ€™s research team specifically for mobiles, which have low memory and power requirements.

This repository contains the details of how to train a lightweight mobilenet for bottle classification. The data is available at my kaggle and can be accessed from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zahidbooni/bottles-dataset 

The dataset contains 19192 small , 9781l large amd 4675 non-bottles objects respectively. I have uploaded the notebook on this repo , it can also be accessed from kaggle using this https://www.kaggle.com/code/zahidbooni/bottles-classification
